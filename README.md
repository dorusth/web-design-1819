## User

#### Larissa
The User I designed my product for is Larissa.
Larissa is blind, she mostly uses a screenreader when using a computer and browsing the web and sometimes uses a braille display.

#### The challenge
The challenge for Larissa is to find a pleasurable way to navigate the web.
Most of the websites do comply to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), but this is just a theoretical list of what works for Accessibility and only adds a functional layer for the user.

How do i design a pleasurable webpage navigation for Larissa



## Prototypes and testing
### Concept
My concept was to focus primarily on the navigation through a webpage and give the user different ways to navigate through the page with the use of skippable content or supporting text

### Round 1
[iterations](https://dorusth.github.io/web-design-1819/opdracht-2/week1/)
For the first round of testing i've made 6 different iterations of content an skippable sections in pages.
For my example i've used a news articles about the 2020 olympic games in tokyo

The testable versions i've made were:
- Controll
	- This version had no skippable content and had the navigation at the top of the page with the content under it.


- Skip to content
	- This page was similar to the first example, but had a skip to content anchor at the start of the page for quick navigation to the content


- Skip to menu
	- This version had the menu at the bottom of the page and a "skip to menu" anchor at the top of the page to get to the menu


- Skip to menu after the heading
	- In this version the menu was at the bottom of the document, but the "skip to menu" anchor was placed after the page heading to first give the user an idea of the page content first.


- Skip to content after the intro text
	- In this version the menu was at the bottom of the document, but the "skip to menu" anchor was placed after the introduction of the article to give the user a brief overview of the subject of the article


- Page summary
	- this version was the same as the controll version, but with the addition of a "page summary" anchor at the start of the page. This anchor lead the user to a section which gives the user a quick summary of the page content and the option to skip to the content or menu afterwards.


##### Round 1 results

The results of the test were that the first 3 versions were conventions that a lot of websites use and mostly add a functional layer but don't add to the pleasurable layer

For the the skip to menu options in the content it was clear that the skip after the heading helped to give a quick indication of what the page was about, but the version where it was put after the introduction caused confusion because it took the user out of the normal page flow.

The version with the page summary was the most interesting to test because it clearly added a more pleasurable layer for Larissa and gave a different experience of the content of the page because she knew straight away what was on the page and if she needed to read it or skip to the menu to get a different article.



### Round 2
[iterations](https://dorusth.github.io/web-design-1819/opdracht-2/week2/)
For the second round of testing i decided to focus on the page summary prototype and iterate on a few versions:

- Short summary
	- This version gave the user a short (single sentence) summary of the page content, followed by the content and menu links


- Long summary
	- This version gave the user a longer summary of the article and what it contained, followed by the content and menu links


- Summary list
	- The last version gave a list of the contents of the page, more like a small navigation or sitemap she could skip through to get a feel of the page.


##### Round 2 results
After testing the final Prototypes I found that all versions added a more pleasurable experience to the page, but that the long summary could be to much information.
The version with the summary list gave the best result, because it gave a quick and clear view of the page content/structure.


### Round 3
The last [iteration](https://dorusth.github.io/web-design-1819/opdracht-2/week3/) was based on the most pleasurable version of the last round with an added layer for a more fun experience

- Summary list
	- This version gave a list of the contents of the page, more like a small navigation or sitemap she could skip through to get a feel of the page.

- Overview page
	- In this version I played around with a version for a home page of a news site an how the page overview would look for the screenreader

- Voice-over Summary
	- the last iteration was an extra version of the summary list in which the page summary was a spoken version to give the user a better experience than the screenreader voice.
	- There was also a spoken version of the full article.

##### round 3 results
This testround was without Larissa, but i've tested it with other students who have also done research on her for the course

The main finding was that for the overview page was that it gave a quicker overview of the page that had a lot of content with a quick navigation through the page itself
Most intresting was the spoken version of the article, the feedback for this version was very positive because it gave more feeling about the article that the user was reading without the screenreader voice.


## Principles

### Exclusive Design Principles

- Study situation
	- for this project i've researched the ways and the tools Larisa uses to browse the web an what were the annoyances she encountered while browsing the web

- Ignore conventions
	- For this one i've wanted to find a different way for the user to get through the page than the default skip to menu/content anchors.

- Prioritise identity
	- For this i've focused on the identity of Larissa and based the iterations on articles about the 2020 olympic games which she will be attending.
	- I've also based the versions on the annoyances she encounters on the web and features she often uses to browse the web.

- Add Nonsense
	- I wanted to add something extra to the page to give the user a better feeling of the site and the content. The voice-over was a nice addition to the page as an extra which enhanced the feeling of the article.


### UI principles

- Progressive disclosure
	- I've added extra content which is only visible to the screenreader when the section is selected by the user.

- Smart organization reduces cognitive load
	 - I've tackled this problem by adding the short summary to the page so the user doesn't have to skip through the whole page to get a picture of the contents of the page
